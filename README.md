# MDAnalysisNote

MDAnalysis and the included algorithms are scientific software that are described in academic publications. Please cite these papers when you use MDAnalysis in published work.

It is possible to automatically generate a list of references for any program that uses MDAnalysis. This list (in common reference manager formats) contains the citations associated with the specific algorithms and libraries that were used in the program.

MDAnalysis library
When using MDAnalysis in published work, please cite the following two papers.

(We are asking you to cite both papers if at all possible because the 2016 paper describes many updates to the original 2011 paper and neither paper on its own provides a comprehensive description of the library. We will publish a complete self-contained paper with the upcoming 1.0 release of MDAnalysis, which will then supersede these two citations.)
